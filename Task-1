/* 
A simple quiz is an interactive game or exercise where participants are asked questions and are provided with multiple answer options.
The goal is to test knowledge or learning on a particular subject or general information. Each question typically has 3â€“4 choices, out of which only one is correct. 
The participant selects the answer they think is right, and at the end of the quiz, their score is calculated based on how many correct answers they chose.
Key Elements of a Simple Quiz:
1.Questions.
2.Answer Options.
3.Scoring.
4.Feedback.
